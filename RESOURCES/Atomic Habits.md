# Aggregation of Marginal Gains
This principle means that making slight improvements in every aspect of an activity can lead to significant overall improvements.
eg. If you broke down everything about riding a bike and improved those things by even 1 percent, your overall gain/improvement would be significant.

# Why small habits make a big difference?
Habits are the compound interest of self improvement. Their effects are compounded as you repeat them. On an individual day their effects seem negligible however over time, the effects are tremendous. Hence habits can essentially be the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is thus the product of daily habits, not a once in lifetime transformation.
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.
eg. If you improve by 1% every day for an year by the end of it, you would around 37 times better than you were when you started. However, if you decline by the same amountm you reach almost 0.

# What Progress is Like?
Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous small actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. The threshold where the major change happens is that the author calls The Plateau of Latent Potential. Initially we hope for linear relation with efforts to result, which is not the case and this leads to the "Valley of Disappointment" where the efforts dont seem to be bearing the desired results but are laying the ground work for what we truly wish to achieve once we cross the "Plateau of Latent Potential".

# Difference between Goals and System
Goals : The results you want to achieve.
System : The processes you follow to achieve your goals.
Focusing on the goals doesn't help you achieve them, whereas focussing on the system, puts you in the right direction by putting in the effort to achieve your goals.
## Problems with goal oriented approach
1. Winners and losers have the same goals, which means that goals arent what makes winners, but the systems they had in place that diffrentiated them from the losers, and helped them win and achieve their goals.
2.
