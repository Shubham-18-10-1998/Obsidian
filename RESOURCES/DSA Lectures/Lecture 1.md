# Introduction
Basic of what are Algorithms and Data Structures along with Big O Notation.


# Approach to solve problem
General Introduction session about DSA sessions and general approach.
Approach for solving problem : Try coming up with a solution on your own.
- Spend time on your own to come up solution.
- Read the problem and at least spend one hour time to come up with solution.
- Then read editorial, hints etc to try taking help. And then spend some more time to come up with solution.
- If doubt too specific, then book doubt session for topics.

# Data Structures
Data Structure : Container for storing and organising data.
- Suitcase has stuff for us to carry, clothes and etc. Container for storing particular object.

# Algorithms
Algorithm : Step-by-step instruction to complete a task.
- eg. - Task to find red color shirt
	- Open suitcase, and then check till found.
- These are usually done on some data stored in some data structure.

Need to access data in future, and hence has to be stored in an organised way.

An algo is correct if it gives the correct answer for all the test cases. Time and space complexity is about the efficiency of the algo. The efficiency comes into picture only when first the algo is correct.

## Efficiency 
- Time Complexity : As once it completes a task quickly, then it can pick up another task. Also it takes money to compute.
- Space Complexity : Memory is fixed, and if it exceeds that limit then it cant do it. Hence optimised version preferred. All memory used is only done on RAM. 

Time Complexity more important as - 
Even to store or retrieve memory time needed. So adding more memory can also cause more time complexity. Also now days memory cheaper and more accessible.

### Complexity Analysis :
- Best Case : 
- Average Case : 
- Worst Case : 
When we are considering for an algo, we always talk in terms of worst case scenario cause we don't know what the input could be.

#### Big O Notations
The complexity is told in terms of input size. 
- eg. - 
	- Time Complexity : O(N) means its linear order complexity where it depends on the input size in case of Linear search. Here O(N+1) is equivalent to O(N) as N is much larger than 1. Hence only the dominant part of the polynomial is taken as other part diminish comparison to major term. 
	- Space Complexity : O(N) for copying an array.
- Rules For complexity
	- Consider only the degree term of the polynomial as other terms diminish wrt to degree term.
	- Also we can ignore the constants.
		- eg. : O(2N^3) is equivalent to O(N^3).
