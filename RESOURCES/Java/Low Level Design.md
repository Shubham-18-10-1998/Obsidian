# What is Low Level Design
- Detailing s systems components, their relationships and interactions
- Blueprint to write code
- Focus 
	- Classes methods, data structures, algorithms and their interactions.
- Objective :
	- Translate high-level architecture into detailed implementation.
- Requirements
	- Functional Requirements : What should system do.
	- Non-Functional Requirements : Performance, security, scalability

# Steps
- Understand problem
- Note down Functional Reqs
- Note down Non-Functional reqs
- Identify entities
- Identify relationships
- Draw high-level diagram
- Go deep into each class 
- Write code

# Parking Lot Problem
- ## Functional Requirements
	- Park car
	- What kind of vehicles
		- Car
		- Truck
		- Two Wheeler
		- Bus
	- Support for multiple floors
		- 1 floor : Simple as everyone at same place
		- Multi-Floor : What basis for segregation for for floors
	- What is payment model for each vehicle
		- One-Time payment
		- Hourly Payment System
		- Vehicle Varied model
	- Support for multiple Payment Method
	- Assisted or Automated
	- Every floor would have 
		- fixed proportion of parking
		- Each floor is blocked for specific vehicle
	- Does each parking spot have multiple vehicles.
		- Each has one capacity
	- Different spots for vehicles.
	- Parking Ticket 
		- Each vehicle has a ticket helps track things
	- Parking allocation strategy
		- Which Floor
		- Which Vehicle
	- Entry and Exit
		- Single entry exit
		- Multiple entry exit
	- Display Panel for full parking lot
		- floor
		- level
	- Fall-back strategy when actual logic is failing. ie,. when spot of each match size isn't available.
	- Summary :
		- Park cars
		- Multiple cars
		- Multiple floors
		- each floor many spots
		- Fixed proportion, or fixed floor
		- allocation strategy to assign cars for floor and on each floor
		- one entry one exit with panels
		- modes of payment
		- Model of payment
		- Parking ticket for logging
		- Panels for information
		- Fall-Back strategy for allocation
- ## Non Functional - 
	- Modularity
	- Separation of concerns
	- Cohesion
	- Coupling
	- Security
- ## Entities
	- What classes, abstract classes, interfaces
	- Relationships
	- Cardinality of relationship
	- SOLIDS, OOPS, Advanced Principles
	- Two Approach 
		- Bottom Up
			- Leaf to top
		- Top Down
			- Top to bottom
	- Vehicle Entity
	- Parking Ticket
	- Parking Floor
	- Parking Lot
	- Parking Spot
	- Payment Processor
	- Floor Allocation Strategy
	- Parking Spot Allocation Strategy
	- Charging Strategy
	- Entry
	- Exit
	- Panels
		- Floor
		- Spot
	- Parking Ticket Generator
