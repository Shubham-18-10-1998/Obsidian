# Introduction
- DRY principle
- KISS principle
- YAGIN
- Association, Composition, Aggregation
- Learner Management System Project

# DRY
- Do not Repeat Yourself
	- Essentially means don't repeat code 
	- Benefits
		- Modular
		- Easy to Reuse
		- Easy to modify
		- Easy to understand / debug

# KISS
- Keep it simple stupid
	- Avoid to many if-else ladder etc to increase complexity

# YAGNI 
- You aren't going to need it
	- Only implement functionality that is needed. Avoid unnecessary complexity and features.

# Association
A lose relationship between objects that are independent and can exist without each other. has a **uses-a** relationship.
eg. Teacher-Student, linked to each other, but can exist without each other. What they mean is relationship like heart and human body where heart exists because of body.
- Here there is no ownership.

# Aggregation
A specialised form of association representing whole part relationship where part can exist independently of whole.
- Has a weak ownership
- HAS a relation.
- Eg. 
	- Department and employee. Department **has a** employee.
		- Both can exist individually.
	- Library **has a** book

# Composition
A strong (whole-part) relationship where part **cannot** exist independently. If whole gets destroyed, then child also gets destroyed. They have **owned** and **lifetime-bound** to parent object.
Eg. 
- Body -> heart
- House -> room

# Project LMS
- Identify the entities
	- Student
	- Teacher
	- Courses
	- Cohort
	- Use ENUM : Set number of values in that.
		- When to have classes and when ENUM?
			- When implementation can be different then different classes.
	- Student and Teacher have common values, then can extend a USER class.
