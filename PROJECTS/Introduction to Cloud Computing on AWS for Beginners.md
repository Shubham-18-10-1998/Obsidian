# Cloud Computing - 
- You don't own or manage the infrastructure on which service runs.
- Services are generally offered on a subscription or consumption model.
- The services automatically scale based on demand.

## Key Characteristics of Cloud 
- **On Demand and Self Service** : User can get services as required, automatically and without human interaction
-  **Broad Network Access** : User can access service over network using standard protocol  like http or private network like using VPN or private connection.
-  **Resource Pooling** : Have aggregated a large pool of compute, storage and networking infrastructure that is then consumed by multiple consumers, with security isolation between them.
- **Rapid Elasticity** : Resources consumed scale based on demand, if demand decreases resources are given back to the pool.
- **Measured Service** : Consumption of resources is monitored and metered to ensure payment for only what is consumed.

## Private Cloud 
Things needed : Network and Firewall, Virtualisation Centre,  Storage and Backup.
Capabilities needed on top : Self Service, Service Catalog, Service automation, Orchestration, Monitoring and logging, Billing and reporting, Multi-Tenancy, Configuration management, LifeCycle Management, Security and Identity.

## Benefits of Cloud
- Variable expense instead of Capital expense.
- Economies of Scale : Large scale availability of resources and consumption of them via large number of clients allow the price to be lower.
- Massive Elasticity.

## Cloud Service Models
- **Private Cloud** : You create your own cloud. This has maximum control.
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** : You are provided a virtual machine running on a server, and you manage from there onward. You manage virtual server onwards. This means OS, updating the OS etc, the framework to run the application, and on top of that data and the application.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** : You just have to bring our code you wanna run. Bring only your data and code. 
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** : You use the service as it is. eg. Salesforce, Gmail etc. This has minimum control.
Control decreases as we me from top to bottom in the above list.
